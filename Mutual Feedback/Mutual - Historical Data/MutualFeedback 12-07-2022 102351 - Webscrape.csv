0,161005,See who i have liked,Moses,"19 Feb, 2021",today,72,1000,A feature that allows you to see a queue of users that you have swiped up on so that you can send notes and revisit.
1,161962,Last onlinerecently active,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,46,507,"A feature that allows you to see how active a user is (e.g., last online 4 hours ago)."
2,164928,Filter church activity,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",today,41,444,The current options we are thinking of are: Not a memberNot activeLess activeActiveAll in Do you think you have a better option list? Should this be optional or mandatory? Share a comment!
3,177816,Skip a profile save for later,Brian,"11 Apr, 2021",today,35,365,"A feature to let you skip a profile and have it come up again later. Sometimes the swiping can be a little indecisive and it would be cool to have an option that isn't as absolute as a down-swipe. (It could even work similar to the Notes feature, that you can only skip a certain number of profiles in a day or something, or more often for the paid version of the app). It would also make navigating the ""See Who Likes Me"" section much easier."
4,161959,Filter children,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,21,240,Filter users based on if they have children or not.
5,161947,Filter interest level,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,36,226,"Currently, we allow you to scale your dating interest level... (e.g., Into Dating I guess, Seeking Friends, Up for Ice Cream, Down for Dates, Up for Dancing!, Looking for Fun, Down for Sweet Dates, Looking for Romance, Seeking a Relationship, Read for a Ring). Cut the chase and filter those who have the same interest level as you do."
6,296565,Remove swipe limit,Sheppard,30 Apr,today,35,199,"As someone who doesn't get tons of matches, it is heart breaking to see and get a limit on swiping. I don't want to pay to increase my chances of matching with someone. Please remove the swipe limit. I'd rather run out of swipes then get told I can't swipe anymore today."
7,169459,Voice messaging,Johnson Daniel Kalu,"15 Mar, 2021",today,11,172,"Use voice notes in addition to typing, makes chatting more engaging and convenient for users."
8,165044,Neighboring countries filter,Erik,"02 Mar, 2021",yesterday,13,124,"Add the filter for ' neighboring countries'. For all us that don't live in the US this feauture would really help and do expand ones search area that's still somewhat close to you, with out going to 'world wide' search."
9,176350,Display full name,KH,"05 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,20,58,"Like Hinge, make it so that if you provide a last name on your profile, it will be shared with users you match with."
10,253422,Description first optionally,Jackson,"03 Dec, 2021",08 Jul,0,29,"Have an option to have the description appear first and then tap to see the pictures. I don't want to use Mutual anymore because I feel it is reinforcing my bad habit of objectifying people and deciding my interest in them primarily based on their looks, and that makes me feel gross. I think switching it so the photos don't appear until you tap, or at least having the option to set it that way if you want, would help."
11,168489,Let queer members match with other queer members,Rachel,"10 Mar, 2021",today,87,1000,"There are so many queer lds members that are trying their best to be happy and still be active in the church and not be suicidal. Many of us are trying to find someone who supports our efforts to keep going to church in this church because we love it and we don't want to leave it. We want to feel welcomed and loved there, and it would be easier to find a path to happiness and also activity in the church if we could meet other queer Mormons."
12,170983,Watch an ad to see a person who likes you,Anonymous,"19 Mar, 2021",today,25,467,"You have ads that pop up occasionally  anyway, and the ""watch an ad to undo"" feature. Having the option to watch an ad to see who likes you would give people a bit more freedom on the app. You could also limit it to something like three ads in a twenty-four hour period."
13,165279,Birthday surprise,Jefferson Glenn,"02 Mar, 2021",yesterday,9,245,"On the Mutual user's birthday, they will be upgraded to MutualUp (premium features) for 24 hours as a birthday gift from Mutual!"
14,157427,Video chat,Moses,"03 Feb, 2021",08 Jul,21,180,Add the video chat feature so users can video chat with each other.
15,161000,Dark mode,Moses,"19 Feb, 2021",yesterday,9,171,Light-on-dark color scheme. This color scheme uses light-colored text and icons on a dark background.
16,161961,Conversation prompts,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",09 Jul,24,162,"It would be nice to have different conversation starters to help you break the ice when matching with another user (e.g., two truths and a lie, best discovery: Netflix or Avocados? etc.)."
17,164962,Hide inactive profiles,Dallin,"02 Mar, 2021",today,2,162,"Profiles that are inactive are hidden after an amount of time. This way when you review those that have liked you, if they haven't been active due to ""they got married or are in a relationship now"" and forgot to delete/ deactivate their profile,  you won't be matching with them and not hearing back from those that are no long available."
18,165319,Higher character count in bio,Qaseem,"02 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,17,148,Increase the current character count by 150-200 characters when typing a bio.

21,164926,Share a profile,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",today,21,132,"Generate a link you can send to a friend that will allow them to see a profile that you saw on mutual. Maybe this isn't your match, but it could be theirs!"
22,175881,Free trial,Erica,"01 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,25,129,do a promo or let us watch adds to have a 24 hour trial of the unlimited version  versus having to commit for a week
23,165329,Increase photo count,Qaseem Maajid-Bey,"02 Mar, 2021",today,3,119,Increase the number of photos on user profiles from 5 to 7
24,176355,When reporting someone there should be an option to upload screenshots,KH,"05 Apr, 2021",today,3,115,"I had to report someone who had sent me sexually explicit gifs and messages, and someone else who had asked for money. It would help to have an option to upload at least one screenshot as proof. Also a little more character space to describe the reason for reporting creeps."
25,161966,Filter divorced,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,25,111,"Allow users to specify on their profile that they are divorced, and make this a filterable attribute on their profile.  Question: If we have options for ""divorced"" or ""widowed"", should there also be an option for ""never married""?"
26,165991,Search by name,Morgan,"03 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,15,111,I'm friends with a lot of husband material guys but both of us are too scared to make a move. They never show up in my feed so it would be nice to search by his name then send him a cute message.
27,170628,Match explanations,Aidan Nemelka,"18 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,3,100,"To help focus on quality instead of quantity, there should be more to it than a mere swipe. Maybe each individual match should be given an idea of where to continue through tags, or a slider like the interest one. They want to talk, they want to go on a date, they think you are attractive, they want to hang out, they want to have fun, grab ice cream, stuff like that... The interest slider doesn't help much. It should be more individual for each match."
28,174999,Allow short videos to be added to profile,Jeannine,"30 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,23,96,(Hinge also does this and this allows you to see more of someone's personality and hear their voice)
29,165068,Age corrections,Meg,"02 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,3,92,I wish the app would stop showing my age a year older just because the year switches. Starting Jan 2021 it shows I'm 29 but I'm still 28 for 6 more months. It should switch your age on your birthday or at least birthday month. I may be filtered out of some searches now.
30,170306,Profile analytics,Robert,"17 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,13,91,"How many people you have swiped on, and percentage swiped up on, in a certain time period or over the lifetime of your profile."
31,179902,Mutual games,Joe,"17 Apr, 2021",yesterday,10,84,Integrate fun little online games to play with your new match.  Games to get to know each other and games to just have a little fun together.  Perhaps Church themed trivia if you must.
32,165005,Share photos send photos in chat,Ejkl,"02 Mar, 2021",today,11,82,During a conversation with a person you should be able to send him a picture.
33,172181,Filter those that like you,Collin,"21 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,6,80,Filter the people that like you in the distance you set instead of showing everyone around the world
34,169249,Video call speed dating,Anonymous,"13 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,11,75,Other apps have this where a few times a week there is a 15min interval where insterested people sign in and get a random date for 3min. Then you can swipe on the person. This could even be a feature for only paying members (or you could have only guys pay for it). I'd totally pay for something like this.
35,176175,Dealbreakers,Damian,"03 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,8,75,"There should be an option for a 'dealbreaker' in the filters. Where they may choose to not have anyone below or above their chosen age, height, or distance filters by selecting the dealbreaker option. On the other hand, they may choose to leave the dealbreaker open and have greater chances for a match."
36,172738,Show likelyhood to respond,Josh,"23 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,8,74,Show me the percentage of how many people someone ignores so I dont seipenup on a ghoster
37,169296,Filter weight,Pedro,"14 Mar, 2021",today,18,69,"If height can be a filter, then weight should be one too."
38,169448,Change unmatch reasons,Nate,"15 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,7,68,"One change I would like would be: Unmatch - without a reason I'd love to be able to unmatch without picking a reason to unmatch. Ie We went on a date and the chemistry wasn't there. Currently, the options all are like ""inappropriate bio, poor offline behavior, etc.... So I don't want to pick that if it was just a lack of chemistry. I also prefer to keep a smaller list of matches. If it's not going to work out, I don't want to see them in my matches"
39,171625,An are you dating someone thing,Mathieu Brewer,"20 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,4,63,I've matched w too many girls who have a bf that are 'just looking for friends' and it's annoying tbh
40,170905,Penalize ignoring a message from a match,Daniel,"18 Mar, 2021",yesterday,17,61,"One of the worst things about Mutual is matching with someone, sending that person a thoughtful message, and then getting ignored. Unfortunately, this happens far too often. Possible remedies:1) Each person has a queue of, say, 5 waiting messages. Each message must be either responded to or the match removed. Once the queue is full, all new matches will be hidden. If someone removes too many matches, his/her ability to swipe is temporarily revoked.2) If someone ignores more than, say, 50% of new match messages, he/she will be forced to initiate conversations or lose the ability to see new profiles. The danger, of course, is that the system would be easy to game. Somehow each person should be incentivized to make meaningful connections, not try to rack up matches to ignore."
41,164958,Nudges or reminders,Sarah,"02 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,2,60,Reminders for people you've matched that the matches are about to expire. It should send notifications/reminders to send them a message.
42,175785,Bring back old matches,Greg,"01 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,3,56,Be able to see people you matched with in the past to retry.
43,172670,Show approximate number of people in range,Robert,"17 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,2,56,"Show how many men and how many women use mutual in a selected range, can be approximate."
44,170894,Filter specific tag,Sanford Bassett,"18 Mar, 2021",08 Jul,61,54,The ability to see people with a specific tag (even a custom tag) would be an excellent addition.
45,179921,Notes should be one per day anytime i want to use it not once every 24 hrs exact,Eliot,"18 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,4,54,"It could be by date change for example not by how many hours have passed since the last time you used a note. For instance, if I use a note at 1030 p.m. on Monday night and for whatever reason want to send another at 1210 a.m. Tuesday I should be able to do that."
46,184861,List view of people whove liked you,Anonymous,"12 May, 2021",yesterday,7,47,Rather than having to go one by one of those who've liked you being able to view in a list similar to bumble would be great!
47,170233,Group date feature,Jaden,"16 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,6,43,"I'm not entirely sure how this would work. I think an option when creating a profile could be to create a group profile. I know people already do this, but making it easier for people would encourage more group profiles. Then it would encourage group dates, which would relieve a lot of the pressure on dating. And it would make mutual safer for all."
48,172119,A notification sound,Bradley,"21 Mar, 2021",08 Jul,2,43,"Whenever I'm outside of the app, I don't notice notifications for sometimes hours, because my phone doesn't vibrate, and no sound goes off, until I turn my screen on and see that the notification is there"
49,161964,Filter pets,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",07 Jul,1,42,"Pets can be a must or a deal-breaker for certain people. Allow users to specify on their profile that they have or want pets, and make this a filterable attribute on their profile."
50,176262,Add additional location filter by state,Ryan,"04 Apr, 2021",yesterday,5,39,"I'd like to filter the search by state. See everyone in Nevada or Texas, etc."
51,180047,Not for me instead of no reason,Kay,"19 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,1,38,"It's such a small thing, but it bugs me every single time. Of course I have a reason for unmatching with someone. And it's not any of those other suggestions. Inappropriate behavior isn't the only reason to move on from someone. I simply wish to discontinue my correspondence with that person. Why does that need to fall under the 'Other' category?"
52,174225,Time stamps,emma,"27 Mar, 2021",08 Jul,3,37,Adding time stamps for each message in a chat would be helpful (I.e. swiping messages to the left to see what time they were sent at)
53,197289,Ghosting ratio,Sunny,"10 Jul, 2021",09 Jul,2,36,"Ghosting isn't the worst but it isn't the best. Have a button for people to report ghosting, ask if their sure, and have the app verify there has been no response for a month or so, then report their statistics on their profile. Get rid of people who chronically ghost others ( >75%)"
54,184344,Picture upload zoom issue,Daniel,"09 May, 2021",08 Jul,6,35,"Change mutual feature to stop uploading pictures automatically zoomed in really far. Every time I add a picture it's super zoomed in, would prefer people to see more of me and surroundings"
55,164998,Filter ethnicity,B,"02 Mar, 2021",today,14,33,
56,165040,Add spotify top artists,Moses,"02 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,4,30,
57,203487,When ward hopping have option to display both real and hopped location,Matt Eden,"17 Aug, 2021",2 days ago,2,29,"It would be nice for the search function to also work from both locations, as the people you are shown have to have your location/statistics within their preferences.  Having both locations displayed would mean you wouldn't have to explain that you dont actually love there."
58,200161,Filter language,Paige,"27 Jul, 2021",08 Jul,13,27,"Filter based on languages. If I only speak English, and a guy doesn't speak English at all, (or vice versa) then it would obviously not be a good match.  For example, users input whatever languages they speak, and then only users with at least one language in common show up as potential matches."
59,190177,See who liked me list view,Michael Patterson,"09 Jun, 2021",yesterday,8,27,"Rather than have a queue of people who liked you, have a list view that allows you to scroll through and like anybody who liked you. This allows you to browse your list without having to make a decision right away and makes it easier to have the conversations you want to have first."
60,183909,Show new people by most compatible first,Laura,"07 May, 2021",09 Jul,2,27,"Instead of showing new people according to random order or by who is closest, show the people with highest compatibility first (those with similar tags, interest level, etc)"
61,190702,Willing to relocate,mark Osborn,"11 Jun, 2021",09 Jul,3,26,Would be nice to know if someone in a different country/state is willing to relocate to my country/state if we hit it off
62,202492,Make the about me section a required field,Moses Lotulelei,"10 Aug, 2021",08 Jul,2,25,"This encourages higher quality profiles which lead to more meaningful conversations. If someone does not write an about me, it's hard to find conversation starters based solely on their pics."
63,164931,Filter favorite school,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,23,24,"Filter through current students/alumni or other users who have a favorite university (e.g. BYU, U of U, Utah State, UVU, etc.)."
64,192803,Friends only section,Adam fox,"19 Jun, 2021",yesterday,14,24,"Used specifically for people just looking for friends, similar to bumble BFF feature. Looking for some homies so this would include dudes seeing other dudes."
65,181754,Filter exclude utah from results,Chris,"26 Apr, 2021",yesterday,0,24,"I've wished this was a feature for years: a filter to exclude Utah from the search location settings. Dating for members outside of Utah, even being a member outside of Utah, can be very different than being a member actually in Utah. And that's a preference that, at least for me, I'm very interested in. When I do an anywhere search, I get tired of seeing all the Utah results (makes sense, largest demographic). However, the outside Utah people, in the US and rest of the world, I find I actually make contact with more often & enjoy talking to much more. It's just a demographic difference. Even offline, members outside of Utah tend to enjoy connecting more, we can drive an hour easy just to gather & hang out for an afternoon. It's a bit more exciting because we're used to being so few. Without this option, the generic anywhere setting still results in the majority of people shown being Utah people."
66,192616,Add a blind dating feature for people who dont want looks to influence if they m,Chad,"19 Jun, 2021",08 Jul,5,22,
67,198340,Filter body type,Stephanie,"17 Jul, 2021",07 Jul,3,22,There was an option for this on ldssingles and many other dating apps. Body types can be something like this: SlimAthleticAbout AverageA Few Extra PoundsCurvyOverweight
68,189478,Get rid of spamfraudulent users,Chele,"07 Jun, 2021",09 Jul,10,21,There is more spam on this account than any other... I have been asked for money at least 5 times.
69,175614,Downvote option on the feedback site,Jared,"31 Mar, 2021",yesterday,5,21,"We should have a downvote option on the feedback site. There are many topics, for instance, NCMO's, that the vast majority are opposed to but which would show an abnormal number of likes if they were posted. This bias is introduced because the parties in favor of said topic are more fanatical than the mainstream party. Feeling a strong connection to it means they upvote. It takes too long for some people to add a comment against a topic and they feel that they would be drowned out by many other comments anyway if they were to post (especially after seeing the many upvotes for that topic).  Downvotes would resove this problem and allow a bigger picture for support or opposition to a topic. At the end of the day, this isn't a democracy anyway; Mutual will decide what policies and practices they adopt on their own. I think downvoting is a necessary part of feedback."
70,170258,Web browser support,Q,"16 Mar, 2021",16 May,10,20,I am a software engineer and can help implement this
71,165226,Facebook mutual friends,Ashlee,"02 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,3,19,Ability to see mutual friends on Facebook so I know who to contact to set me up!
72,176263,Reset all swipes option,Ryan,"04 Apr, 2021",09 Jul,1,19,"The current refresh oldest 100 thing is very glitchy right now. I click it, but nothing happens unless I change my search parameters. Go back to what we had before."
73,181384,Photo age,Joseph Smith,"23 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,2,18,A date stamp (can be approximate) that tells how old photos are
74,173621,Translate messages,Giovanna,"25 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,7,17,Many times there are people who know each other but cannot speak due to the language difference.
75,169247,Fix ig integration,Anonymous,"13 Mar, 2021",yesterday,2,17,Ig photos are zoomed in when expanded and there is no way to scroll the image
76,164972,World wide distance,Cole,"02 Mar, 2021",03 Jul,2,17,"If I choose to look at everyone world wide, it would be nice to have an option where the distance starts out close to my area then slowly expands outward"
77,173851,Limit new matches based on how often you respond to the ones you already have,Josh,"26 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,0,17,"If you want to keep matching/swiping, you should either delete older matches that you've lost interest in, or respond to matches you already have. People would be way less likely to swipe up on people they would ghost, and they may even find love with an old match. It's a good way of encouraging people to seriously investigate people, or at least not waste other people's time. It would also make the ""see who likes me"" feature more appealing since people would want to make the best use of their limited match space.I'd be more interested in a person if I knew they had limited storage and used some on me. Someone with full storage could still come up on other people's feed,  but their feed would say ""You've been talking to 2 out of your 30 matches in the last week.  Reach out to some before you keep matching""People who regularly respond wouldn't have that issue or would at least have more storage. Potentially another premium feature.  50 matches instead of 30. Thank you"

79,194118,Add education level,Holly,"26 Jun, 2021",today,3,16,"As someone with a masters degree who makes Clos to 6 figures, I don't want someone who has been working at Walmart since high school. I want an equal. Education is important to me, I also want it to be important to my partner.  It could be a drop down with options: (high school, tech school, some college, bachelor's, graduate degree)"
80,165321,Minimum character count in bio,Qaseem Maajid-Bey,"02 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,2,16,Have a minimum character count in the bio to encourage people to talk about themselves and increase interest.
81,172209,Home screen should be messaging,Dan,"21 Mar, 2021",22 May,0,16,Home Screen should be messaging not back to more profiles. This will allow us to focus on our matches and not on just swiping.
82,199535,Fix photo sizing,Kyra,"26 Jul, 2021",today,4,15,"Sometimes when I try to add a photo that isn't the exact size it needs it to be, I have to resize it or screenshot it. Some of them turn out blurry or sized weird"
83,192610,Add a section asking about covid vaccination status,Chad,"19 Jun, 2021",yesterday,4,15,
84,179087,Add more then 2 letters for the state or country better geographic clarity pleas,James McLean,"14 Apr, 2021",yesterday,0,15,"As a global app, 2 letters is just not enough to clearly identify the location. What does CA mean? Cambodia, Canada, California'?. 2 letters are not enough, especially when you're not even consistent with whether it is a state or country. If it is a state then add the country. Better yet, you could use a small pic of the country's flag. That would save screen space and add character to the app."
85,175897,Publish dating market statistics for an area,Trent,"02 Apr, 2021",09 Jul,0,15,"Or sell them, if mutual needs the money. Basically the app has a lot of interesting data already (how many lds people are dating in X city, how many swipes result in a match, how many matches result in a two way message, what portion of users are male/female in a given area, how many people does it take to get a match on average, etc).  YSA move around a lot and it would be very helpful and valuable to have an idea for these sorts of things ('oh, the job offer in Chicago has 200 mutual users in the area, but the offer in DC has 600, good to know'). I bet plenty of users would pay $10+ for a detailed report and it would cost very little to produce since the app already knows it's user base.  More personalized reports like 'X percent of people swipe up on this photo, Y percent on this other photo' or even 'of 1000 male profiles in the area, users swipe on you more than they do on 550 of the others' etc would also be interesting. The user base generates the data, let them see it."
86,173770,Party room,Braeden,"25 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,0,15,"(This tries to mirror connecting with people at a party)  Display the first profile pic of 6 different people side by side. The user taps 2 of those people to ""get to know better"". The other 4 people go away, and the user sees those 2 people's whole profile.  They swipe up or down, then 6 new people come up, in the same process.  The 4 people they did not choose do not show up again for 1 week (or maybe 24 hours), after which they will come back around in the rotation.  (This adds a fun element of decision, sort of like at a party where you have a limited amount of time to spend talking to people) Might be a fun twist!"
87,164969,Scroll bar,Cole,"02 Mar, 2021",03 Jul,0,15,"Make the distance bar not a slide bar, but instead one of those scroll wheel things. The slide bar is too inconvenient for thousands of miles to be on"

89,186715,Allow those who you have liked to see you liked them,Anonymous,"21 May, 2021",09 Jul,2,13,"When people pay for the membership on the app, it should allow people who you swipe up on be able to see that you want to connect with them. Otherwise I feel like you have just as much of a chance of finding a connection as someone who doesn't pay for the app."
90,194685,See at least 1 person per week,Micah Conover,"29 Jun, 2021",2 days ago,0,13,"I think it would be nice to get to see at least 1 person who likes me per week for free. That wouldn't get rid of the incentive to pay to see the 99+ people who like me, but it would make it so I could match a little more easily. Sometimes it's discouraging to swipe for a long while, and exit the app without any luck. Being able to see someone who likes me each week, would at least insure that I come across something that could be mutual, once in a while."
91,192772,Be able to set your location to your home city while traveling,Jacob Coleman,"19 Jun, 2021",09 Jul,0,13,It would be great to be able to still have your location be your home location while traveling. This way you can still find singles within reasonable distance while traveling and not feel like the app is completely useless because it's you can only look at singles in your vacation location.
92,173521,Questionnaire,Jared,"25 Mar, 2021",09 Jul,0,13,"Everyone can answer the questions they're comfortable with and then you can check a match's answers to the questions that you've answered yourself. In order to see the answers to questions that you haven't taken, you have to answer the corresponding question (to prevent ppl from saying what a match wants to hear). To prevent addictive behavior and to reward consistent app use, there could be a limit to the number of questions that can be answered per day (e.g. 10 questions). Maybe this wouldn't apply to answering questions a match had answered (while looking at a match). Premium users could then see a match % based on the questions and interest tags"

How many use the second look option

They found this out at a family funeral and as you can imagine, it was quite funny/awkward. Since there are no last names, I think the family tree app that says how closely you're related would be helpful hahah."
97,201410,Rollover notes,Barry,"03 Aug, 2021",09 Jul,1,12,"It's the same concept as rollover minutes, but for notes!  So, let's say I have 1 note on day 1, but I do not use it.  On day 2 I will have 2 notes to use!  If I don't use either of those notes on day 2, I will end up with 3 notes on day 3, and so on!"

100,202149,React to messages sent,Kristina Cannon,"09 Aug, 2021",09 Jul,0,12,"An awesome feature would be to mirror iphone messages/instagram dms with how you can react to messages sent to you. I love being able to heart a message, emphasize a message etc. I just had the thought to maybe add another feature where you can reply to specific messages like you can imessage."
101,176239,Pause profile,Amanda,"04 Apr, 2021",03 Jul,0,12,It would be cool if we could pause our accounts for a while if we don't want to deactivate it but we also aren't wanting to show up on other people's profiles or anything.
102,175898,Option for more detailed profile info,Trent,"02 Apr, 2021",07 Jul,0,12,"Allow users to create a 'bonus' profile with more personal information about what they want in life, what they're into, what they care abt in a partner etc that they can grant access to after matching or after going out w another user and having a good time.  Profiles (and first dates) tend to be intentionally light hearted and nobody wants to ask 'how many kids do you want to have' or 'are you/have you been a pornography user' or 'what sort of income/spending level do you expect to have' or 'what is something that you find attractive/unattractive in a partner' or 'if your spouse left the church do you think you'd be more likely to break up, or to leave the church yourself' etc etc.  Basically it would be like a 'level 2' profile that you share selectively w someone once you've built some trust or connection. Nobody wants to go into date one or two throwing those topics on the table at a restaurant but many people are interested in them for compatibility."
103,177626,Repeal height filter,Aaron,"09 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,8,11,This encourages the stigma of rejecting someone based on their height. A genetic predisposition that cannot be changed.
104,186181,Optional profile feedback,Jeremy,"18 May, 2021",yesterday,4,11,"Instead of swiping down, the user could have the option to provide constructive feedback on a profile by choosing from a list of common profile mistakes or sending an anonymous message.  Examples:Too many people in photosUnflattering photosInappropriate photosGeneric descriptionSpelling and grammarBio is negative, disrespectful, immature, boring, too brief, inappropriateToo few or too many interests User could select all that apply. Receiving feedback could be opt-in only. Feedback could also be in the form of an anonymous message but would probably be abused. Inappropriate messages could be reported."
105,202557,Message preview in notification,Sterling,"10 Aug, 2021",09 Jul,2,11,"I want the notification on my phone to have the message they sent displayed, just like every other messages app I've ever used. I am fairly confident this will significantly reduce people unintentionally ghosting each other and generally help response times. This is the norm for messaging across the boards on smartphones, and would be very useful here. Every app also has a setting to disable it, which y'all could also throw in there pretty easily"

108,188116,Get rid of say hi,J,"31 May, 2021",08 Jul,1,11,"In addition to the suggestion for conversation prompts... it would be amazing to replace the 'say hi' prompt that comes up after a match, because that is quite often the ONLY thing that people say... and I had to stop getting mad when I realized that people are just doing what the app told them to do :P"
109,193363,Reasons for swiping,Holly,"23 Jun, 2021",2 days ago,0,11,"When you match or don't match with someone, have a selection option for why you swiped the way you did. Then mutual could maybe filter so similar people show up more often. These could also just let mutual know what things we swipe based on. Even if it's every few swipes instead of every one..."
110,189884,Verified profiles filter for them,Jeramy,"08 Jun, 2021",09 Jul,6,10,"I'm tired of getting fake profiles matching who have little to no bio, rarely any info that checks out, and upon further inspection after matching the 3 photos they uploaded are of three separate women that were ripped off Insta or random online searches. Verified Profiles and a way to search only those verified would be wonderful!"
111,266157,The new about me section is too short,Liz,"27 Dec, 2021",09 Jul,4,10,"The old section was much better. I really felt like I could learn a bit about a person. This is way too short now! Other sites like Hinge and Bumble include a lot more info in your stats section (kids status, politics etc) so they don't need as much room in the About Me section but this is ridiculously short!!"
112,189906,Make the distance slider better,Ryan,"08 Jun, 2021",2 days ago,3,10,The distance slider should be exponential. The most useful range is 0-40 miles anyway so instead of that being 4mm long on the slider it should take up half of the slider.
113,187180,Purge users,Bparks,"25 May, 2021",07 Jul,0,10,"I get the feeling that a lot of the people on the app are married or don't use it. In other words, it feels like the swiping is bloated based off of false profiles. Maybe consider purging users who have been inactive for a couple of years."
114,186991,Check to mark your divorce is finalized,A,"23 May, 2021",2 days ago,0,10,"I've come across so many guys where they are still married. It's in the fine print your divorce needs to be finalized, but you need to make them actually check a box to move on the next page of setting up their profile. It needs to be in their face"

118,200613,No dead animals,Kelsi,"28 Jul, 2021",2 days ago,2,9,"I'm so sick of seeing dead deer, elk, fish, etc. on guys' profiles. There are other photos someone can upload to indicate they enjoy hunting and/or fishing, but nobody needs to see the actual dead animal."
119,184715,Show which chats you havent replied to,Alex,"11 May, 2021",07 Jul,1,9,Matches seem to come in waves and sometimes its easy to miss or forget to reply to a message when there's a bunch at once. In other apps there's an icon in your list of chats showing which convos are 'your turn' to reply. This makes it a lot easier to not miss a message and or remember to reply if you checked it while busy.
120,307193,Lower subscription price,Bay,11 Jun,yesterday,0,9,Self explanatory ^ This app is mostly made up of high school/college students.  This app is way too expensive.

123,210998,Superlike feature,alberthallingtonianianan,"31 Aug, 2021",2 days ago,0,9,"It can be difficult to tell if a swipe means anything coming from another party. It could mean they're actually interested, or it could (and only too often does) mean absolutely nothing at all. It would be appropriate to have some sort of ""superlike"" feature that would allow you to do one of two things: 1 - ""superlike"" a profile as you're casually swiping. This could be some sort of button or whatever, similar to how you would send a note... but not necessarily needing to send a message.  2 - provided you have already matched with someone, you could ""upgrade"" your ""like"" to a ""superlike"" and thus let the other person know you're ACTUALLY INTERESTED.  This simple feature would eliminate a great deal of confusion."
124,164959,Tagging the other people in the photo,Alex,"02 Mar, 2021",08 Jul,0,9,Sometimes I wanna know who the other cutie is... so if they like tagged their profile or insta that would be great

Many people are looking for someone with particular traits like blond hair, blue eyes etc. For those people it would make the app more effective by incorporating this feature.

I have no idea what they look like when they do that.  When creating your account maybe have suggestions for adding pictures and maybe an AI to detect if the picture ""doesn't show you very well"" doesn't have to block the picture just.. suggest an edit."
133,222916,Another ui overhaul,Ammon,"09 Oct, 2021",03 Jul,2,7,"The latest UI update that changed the majority of the app interface is just bad. The change in font, the positioning of names/locations, and the massive menu bar at the bottom makes it feel like an app from 2012, not 2021. The old design was SO clean and easy to use, I can't understand what possessed the team to make such drastic changes for the worse. In its current state, I have a hard time spending any time in the app because it feels so stunted and clunky. My suggestion in one sentence: Revert the UI back to the old version or spend more time making it better."
134,190987,Account vacationtake a break mode,Adam Proctor,"13 Jun, 2021","17 Dec, 2021",2,7,You can set your account to take a break beachside you need some time away but don't want to delete or leave it live and do am major clean up. This is so you don't need to delete the account and you would not come back to matches that that may have been around and the user think you did not

145,175219,Down to chat toggle,Jairon Terrero,"30 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,3,6,"Even if I swipe down on someone, I'm still more than happy to chat, exchange memes, and make friends that person. Similarly, I would love to just make friends with the people that I don't match with (regardless of which of us doesn't swipe up). I think making a dynamic that allows people to get to know each other without any expectations about having to go on a date or make a relationship would make the process more natural and appealing to everyone. As such, it would be cool to be able to toggle a feature that lets anyone say hi to me (or me to them if they have it enabled). I realize this is an awful lot like sending notes, but I feel like sending notes just seems act of desperation haha so I never do it. All in all, it would be great if the platform could be used to meet friends rather than only bringing together people who both find each other attractive."
146,210999,Match guide,alberthallingtonianianan,"31 Aug, 2021",07 Jul,2,6,"This is a feature that facebook dating has and that I think would do absolutely wonderful on mutual. You should be able to (and even be encouraged to) fill out a voluntary ""match guide"" that would give your potential matches some sort of idea what you expect. Some people handle sarcasm really well, others not so much. Some people want a funny, cheesy, sarcastic pickup line, while other people think those are dumb and would prefer you to be direct.  A short ""match guide"" that users fill out and that would be displayed once you match with someone would really help both parties understand what the other is expecting and would likely lead to better conversations, more engagement, and thus more success, more refferals to mutual, more time spent on the app, more ad impressions, more mutualUp users, etc.  Beneficial to all parties involved."
147,205322,Matchmaking mode,David,"28 Aug, 2021",11 Jun,2,6,Youre shown two random profiles and you get to decide if you think they seem like a good match. Recommendations are sent to people based on who others have matched them with. You get trophies or something if you set up a successful match

I don't want to pay to see exactly who likes me. Please mix them in with all the other people. This seems like the opposite of what this app is supposed to do.

156,195253,Pause locations,Josh,"02 Jul, 2021",03 Jul,0,6,"I think it'd be great to pause your location for when you go on short trips. That way you can still be active but not have your location change because you're away for the weekend. In situations where it's a longer trip, i.e. more than a week or two, users should probably pause their profile or just not use Mutual for the time being."

158,188240,X miles away,Madeleine,"01 Jun, 2021",03 Jul,3,5,"We have our distance filters, but some live in areas with very few members and must set the distance filter to 100, 200, or 250 miles for enough variety/choices.  It would be nice to see an exact distance with a given match so you don't have to google their location to see how difficult it would be to actually meet up in person."
159,281412,Force users to complete verification,Michael,20 Feb,09 Jul,1,5,"Users should be forced complete verification before they can show up in the matchmaker.

163,188038,Change ux to incorporate text and pictures,Joshua,"30 May, 2021","04 Sep, 2021",1,5,"Instead of tapping to see more about a person, you swiping left and right should alternate between pictures and text.

Regular membership for $4.99/mo with up to three matches that have unlimited messages after the first five. Premium membership for $9.99/mo that allows unlimited everything and includes other perks like video calls, giveaways for dates, calendar sharing so people can set up dates, discounts to events when tickets are bought through the app and more. Most other dating apps make most of their money through sponsorships for discount codes and purchase made through them."
165,284245,Change the screen after a match,Aaron,05 Mar,09 Jul,0,5,The screen we see when we match with someone causes a poor experience. We see half of our own face (which isn't pretty unnecessary) and half the face of the person we matched with (which is pretty unhelpful). The only thing we can do at that point is message the person right away and can't even view their profile.  The only way we can look at their profile to do that is to exit out of the 50% face screen and go into our conversations to find the people we've matched with but haven't yet spoken to. It doesn't flow well at all. It would be better if we could see right into their profile to find a picture or party of their bio to comment on.
166,269055,Replace gloomy cloud image,Jonathan,05 Jan,09 Jul,0,5,"Please replace the gloomy gray cloud image when there are no more results. Maybe a sky image, or a temple, or the mountains or ocean. That gray photo is so depressing. It's sad enough that there are no more results, we need a photo that communicates hope and happiness, not that we're entering outer darkness. Thank you so much!!!"

171,218963,Allow users to hide read receipts,Michael Allen,"26 Sep, 2021",07 Jul,0,5,"Not everyone has the time to respond right away to messages. Users should be allowed to enable and disable read receipts. On Mutual, this appears as two check marks next to a sent message that has been viewed by the receiver. Other dating apps allow you to do this. It could be a simple toggle switch in the settings of the app."
172,197187,Remove unnecessary notifications,Mac,"09 Jul, 2021",27 May,0,5,"I posted this before and they labeled it as a bug. THIS IS NOT A BUG! It's unnecessary notifications that are akin to Facebook sending ""someone you MIGHT know is on facebook"". I don't care and it's a shameless attempt to get people to get on the app and it's so annoying! The worst part is that if you turn off these notifications it also turns off notifications for matches and messages. I just want you to get rid of irrelevant and unnecessary notifications."
173,188057,Reset undo removed deleted match matches,Dallin,"30 May, 2021",23 Feb,0,5,"At times I have unmatched from multiple women (deleted/removed a match) and wish I could undo it, but I can't. The only way is if I delete my profile and start a new profile from scratch with the hope of finding them again."
174,183418,List location next to name in matches and archives,Brett,"04 May, 2021",27 May,0,5,"It is possible to accumulate quite a few contacts in Matches and Archives scattered all over the country, people I would love to meet in person, but it is tough to remember where they are from. It would be nice if next to their name in Matches and Archives it displayed their location as well. It seems like it would be easy to implement and it would be very handy... at least to me."
175,264559,New layout problematic,Mikki,"22 Dec, 2021",17 Feb,6,4,"Hi. Mutual is a great app and has always been super user friendly. The new layout design, however, is problematic. When you click on a profile to get someone's info and read their profile, some of the info is cut off as it doesn't fill the whole screen. There are many profiles I've clicked on where their height (in the upper right hand corner) gets cut off. Height is important to me, so that is very problematic. Why did you change the layout? It was actually better before. :)"

181,184394,Have mutual make leaving feedback or contacting admin easily accessible,Danny,"10 May, 2021",05 Jan,1,4,"There have been a few times that I have had a suggestion or an issue, and unless I get the admin profile to 'make a suggestion' inserted between actual profiles, I can't make any suggestions or inquiries. There is no 'contact us' section or an easily and readily accessible comment link. It is random by chance when you are swiping on profiles. It seems to me that any app, particularly one that doesn't mind taking our money, really ought to make suggestions or issues something that everyone can easily do and find. It is phenomenally  frustrating and shady looking when you don't."
182,168995,A mutual themed apples to apples like game called its mutual,Samuel Ambler,"12 Mar, 2021","23 Jun, 2021",1,4,"The game is like apples to apples or what do you meme but based on Mutual. Basically someone will read a card which is the initial message after matching and then everyone else will put in a card with the response and then the reader will read the responses and choose the best/funniest. An example could be the initial card just says ""Hey."" And then some responses could be ""I think you should talk to your bishop"", ""Not what I was expecting from an RM"" or ""You're definitely EC material"". The name of the game would then be It's Mutual"
183,285801,Gpsprivacy,None of your beeswax,14 Mar,09 Jul,0,4,"GPS is wrong. Since you're the one who know your legal address and may or may not be accessing the app from home, you should be able to manually edit where you are from, choose if you want the app to access your GPS or not, and still be able to use the app. Being forced to provide the physical location where you are at any exact moment in order to use the app at all is invasive to privacy/not safe, potentially inaccurate to where one lives, and a violation of free agency. Manually typing in a city/state or zip code for a general search, and selecting to keep ones location private should be allowed."

185,232160,Swipe up feedback,Sid,"12 Nov, 2021",05 Jul,0,4,"I love the Hinge app's feature that requires a user to select a specific part of a person's profile to like in order to 'swipe up' on someone. It personalizes the 'swiping' a bit more & makes users slow down a bit. The option to include a message too, with the 'like' selection, is pretty nice as well. This feature gives feedback to the person in a positive manner about what the user found interesting in one's profile and allows conversation to start more naturally by allowing one to essentially comment on a specific part of a profile. Also, likely because of this feature, the app has spread out the photos between prompts, which makes the profile more interesting to look through and encourages reading about the individual rather than solely paying attention to looks initially."

192,186483,Height filter,Ella,"20 May, 2021",07 Jul,0,4,"I don't understand why the height filter only works on my end. I only see specific people of the height range that I set, but people who are below/above that range can still swipe on me, which then shows up in my 'see people who have swiped up on you' section. I have that filter set for a reason. This doesn't happen with the age filter. I don't think anyone above or below my age range can see me. Why can't that happen with the height filter?"
193,175297,See who has premium,Mary,"31 Mar, 2021","03 May, 2021",0,4,"Nothing is worse than being left on read. So sometimes I'd like to be able to know if the other person has premium so I know if they see when I open their message or not. Sometimes I'm just busy and can't respond right away, but if I know they've seen that I've read their message, I'd try to answer more quickly. If they can't see it, I wouldn't feel anxious for reading it and not responding ASAP."

201,306328,Filter out inactive or hardly used profiles,Thomas F,08 Jun,05 Jul,0,3,"It seems like I run into lots of people I'm interested in, however It never seems to go anywhere. Just because the people I'm Interested in to begin with never get on Mutual. So I don't know if there's a way to make a filter so the people who use Mutual frequently enough who they can talk to. I know there's the verified profile thing, but beyond that I don't know of anything else. I feel like this would be helpful to do."

203,299626,Three strikes youre out,JJ,13 May,2 days ago,0,3,"For the sisters, and the brethren, but especially for the sisters being bothered by any potential sex pests, making an option to tag a conversation with a red flag that gets the pest blocked from that user but also filters them into a pool where if they are flagged by two other people as inappropriate gets their account reviewed for permanent deletion. That way Mutual creators don't have to take it upon themselves what is and isn't appropriate, like Twitter. But the person making judgement call on what is and isn't appropriate to them is the person the comments are being directed at.  One case could just be a difference of opinions on what is and isn't appropriate. Three cases is a red flag for review.  The system would also work for people soliciting money."

A 'freeze profile/chat' feature would still show you in current matches with others, but you wouldn't show up as available in future searches, and your profile would appear blurred or washed out so existing matches could see you are temporarily unavailable but interested in picking things up in the future. :)It is also frustrating to match with people who may just have neglected to shut down their profile after starting a relationship, so you never hear from them."

This would make people self impose swiping limits and increase connection rather than just swiping mindlessly. This also would make it so sending notes is more normal and natural. On other apps like hinge, where leaving comments is as common as just a like,  you get so much more conversation and connection than on swiping apps"

Or if you tried to join a ""45-60 LDS Singles"" group, you would have to be approved possibly by an admin or something of the group...Or they could be just locations around the world that anyone can join to meet others.

Well, this is a lost opportunity that this and every other dating app has missed. Instead of this tedious 1-to-1 matching method, which, let's face it, is mathematically unlikely to find your ""solemate"" or similar (search for the relevant XKCD What If article), instead, let's leverage the connections and friendships we each have. Similar to the ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"", everyone on the planet is connected by only a few steps. Let's find a way that we can each play ""matchmaker"" and bless those who are frustrated after years of endless swiping. Here is a proposal: I pay a $17 bounty to Mutual, and Mutual will broker/reward $15 (or one month free subscription) to whoever shares my profile with the kind of girl I'm looking for, and said girl agrees that I seem pretty awesome and accepts the recommendation.  Any better ideas?"
