0,161005,See who i have liked,Moses,"19 Feb, 2021",today,72,Planned,1000,A feature that allows you to see a queue of users that you have swiped up on so that you can send notes and revisit.
1,161962,Last onlinerecently active,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,48,In Development,527,"A feature that allows you to see how active a user is (e.g., last online 4 hours ago)."
2,164928,Filter church activity,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",11 Aug,42,Done,458,The current options we are thinking of are: Not a memberNot activeLess activeActiveAll in Do you think you have a better option list? Should this be optional or mandatory? Share a comment!
3,177816,Skip a profile save for later,Brian,"11 Apr, 2021",today,36,Under consideration,401,"A feature to let you skip a profile and have it come up again later. Sometimes the swiping can be a little indecisive and it would be cool to have an option that isn't as absolute as a down-swipe. (It could even work similar to the Notes feature, that you can only skip a certain number of profiles in a day or something, or more often for the paid version of the app). It would also make navigating the ""See Who Likes Me"" section much easier."
4,296565,Remove swipe limit,Sheppard,30 Apr,yesterday,41,Under consideration,252,"As someone who doesn't get tons of matches, it is heart breaking to see and get a limit on swiping. I don't want to pay to increase my chances of matching with someone. Please remove the swipe limit. I'd rather run out of swipes then get told I can't swipe anymore today."
5,161959,Filter children,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",today,22,Done,251,Filter users based on if they have children or not.
6,161947,Filter interest level,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",09 Aug,37,Done,236,"Currently, we allow you to scale your dating interest level... (e.g., Into Dating I guess, Seeking Friends, Up for Ice Cream, Down for Dates, Up for Dancing!, Looking for Fun, Down for Sweet Dates, Looking for Romance, Seeking a Relationship, Read for a Ring). Cut the chase and filter those who have the same interest level as you do."
7,169459,Voice messaging,Johnson Daniel Kalu,"15 Mar, 2021",13 Aug,11,Under consideration,181,"Use voice notes in addition to typing, makes chatting more engaging and convenient for users."
8,165044,Neighboring countries filter,Erik,"02 Mar, 2021",today,16,Under consideration,139,"Add the filter for ' neighboring countries'. For all us that don't live in the US this feauture would really help and do expand ones search area that's still somewhat close to you, with out going to 'world wide' search."
9,176350,Display full name,KH,"05 Apr, 2021",14 Aug,24,Under consideration,64,"Like Hinge, make it so that if you provide a last name on your profile, it will be shared with users you match with."
10,253422,Description first optionally,Jackson,"03 Dec, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,35,"Have an option to have the description appear first and then tap to see the pictures. I don't want to use Mutual anymore because I feel it is reinforcing my bad habit of objectifying people and deciding my interest in them primarily based on their looks, and that makes me feel gross. I think switching it so the photos don't appear until you tap, or at least having the option to set it that way if you want, would help."
11,168489,Let queer members match with other queer members,Rachel,"10 Mar, 2021",08 Aug,96,Under consideration,1000,"There are so many queer lds members that are trying their best to be happy and still be active in the church and not be suicidal. Many of us are trying to find someone who supports our efforts to keep going to church in this church because we love it and we don't want to leave it. We want to feel welcomed and loved there, and it would be easier to find a path to happiness and also activity in the church if we could meet other queer Mormons."
12,170983,Watch an ad to see a person who likes you,Anonymous,"19 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,27,Under consideration,501,"You have ads that pop up occasionally  anyway, and the ""watch an ad to undo"" feature. Having the option to watch an ad to see who likes you would give people a bit more freedom on the app. You could also limit it to something like three ads in a twenty-four hour period."
13,165279,Birthday surprise,Jefferson Glenn,"02 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,9,Under consideration,261,"On the Mutual user's birthday, they will be upgraded to MutualUp (premium features) for 24 hours as a birthday gift from Mutual!"

16,164962,Hide inactive profiles,Dallin,"02 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,2,Done,171,"Profiles that are inactive are hidden after an amount of time. This way when you review those that have liked you, if they haven't been active due to ""they got married or are in a relationship now"" and forgot to delete/ deactivate their profile,  you won't be matching with them and not hearing back from those that are no long available."
17,161961,Conversation prompts,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",09 Aug,24,Done,165,"It would be nice to have different conversation starters to help you break the ice when matching with another user (e.g., two truths and a lie, best discovery: Netflix or Avocados? etc.)."
18,165319,Higher character count in bio,Qaseem,"02 Mar, 2021",22 Jul,17,Done,151,Increase the current character count by 150-200 characters when typing a bio.

22,164926,Share a profile,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",11 Aug,21,Done,133,"Generate a link you can send to a friend that will allow them to see a profile that you saw on mutual. Maybe this isn't your match, but it could be theirs!"
23,165329,Increase photo count,Qaseem Maajid-Bey,"02 Mar, 2021",today,3,Under consideration,124,Increase the number of photos on user profiles from 5 to 7
24,176355,When reporting someone there should be an option to upload screenshots,KH,"05 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,4,In Development,121,"I had to report someone who had sent me sexually explicit gifs and messages, and someone else who had asked for money. It would help to have an option to upload at least one screenshot as proof. Also a little more character space to describe the reason for reporting creeps."
25,165991,Search by name,Morgan,"03 Mar, 2021",today,16,Under consideration,120,I'm friends with a lot of husband material guys but both of us are too scared to make a move. They never show up in my feed so it would be nice to search by his name then send him a cute message.
26,161966,Filter divorced,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",12 Aug,25,Done,118,"Allow users to specify on their profile that they are divorced, and make this a filterable attribute on their profile.  Question: If we have options for ""divorced"" or ""widowed"", should there also be an option for ""never married""?"
27,170628,Match explanations,Aidan Nemelka,"18 Mar, 2021",today,4,Planned,110,"To help focus on quality instead of quantity, there should be more to it than a mere swipe. Maybe each individual match should be given an idea of where to continue through tags, or a slider like the interest one. They want to talk, they want to go on a date, they think you are attractive, they want to hang out, they want to have fun, grab ice cream, stuff like that... The interest slider doesn't help much. It should be more individual for each match."
28,174999,Allow short videos to be added to profile,Jeannine,"30 Mar, 2021",today,23,Under consideration,105,(Hinge also does this and this allows you to see more of someone's personality and hear their voice)
29,170306,Profile analytics,Robert,"17 Mar, 2021",today,14,Under consideration,99,"How many people you have swiped on, and percentage swiped up on, in a certain time period or over the lifetime of your profile."
30,165068,Age corrections,Meg,"02 Mar, 2021",today,4,Under consideration,97,I wish the app would stop showing my age a year older just because the year switches. Starting Jan 2021 it shows I'm 29 but I'm still 28 for 6 more months. It should switch your age on your birthday or at least birthday month. I may be filtered out of some searches now.
31,165005,Share photos send photos in chat,Ejkl,"02 Mar, 2021",today,14,Under consideration,95,During a conversation with a person you should be able to send him a picture.
32,179902,Mutual games,Joe,"17 Apr, 2021",today,10,Under consideration,93,Integrate fun little online games to play with your new match.  Games to get to know each other and games to just have a little fun together.  Perhaps Church themed trivia if you must.
33,169249,Video call speed dating,Anonymous,"13 Mar, 2021",09 Aug,12,Under consideration,81,Other apps have this where a few times a week there is a 15min interval where insterested people sign in and get a random date for 3min. Then you can swipe on the person. This could even be a feature for only paying members (or you could have only guys pay for it). I'd totally pay for something like this.
34,172181,Filter those that like you,Collin,"21 Mar, 2021",10 Jul,6,Done,80,Filter the people that like you in the distance you set instead of showing everyone around the world
35,176175,Dealbreakers,Damian,"03 Apr, 2021",02 Aug,9,Done,77,"There should be an option for a 'dealbreaker' in the filters. Where they may choose to not have anyone below or above their chosen age, height, or distance filters by selecting the dealbreaker option. On the other hand, they may choose to leave the dealbreaker open and have greater chances for a match."
36,172738,Show likelyhood to respond,Josh,"23 Mar, 2021",10 Aug,8,Under consideration,76,Show me the percentage of how many people someone ignores so I dont seipenup on a ghoster
37,169296,Filter weight,Pedro,"14 Mar, 2021",08 Aug,19,Not planned,75,"If height can be a filter, then weight should be one too."
38,169448,Change unmatch reasons,Nate,"15 Mar, 2021",today,7,In Development,69,"One change I would like would be: Unmatch - without a reason I'd love to be able to unmatch without picking a reason to unmatch. Ie We went on a date and the chemistry wasn't there. Currently, the options all are like ""inappropriate bio, poor offline behavior, etc.... So I don't want to pick that if it was just a lack of chemistry. I also prefer to keep a smaller list of matches. If it's not going to work out, I don't want to see them in my matches"
39,171625,An are you dating someone thing,Mathieu Brewer,"20 Mar, 2021",today,4,Under consideration,67,I've matched w too many girls who have a bf that are 'just looking for friends' and it's annoying tbh
40,170905,Penalize ignoring a message from a match,Daniel,"18 Mar, 2021",today,18,Under consideration,66,"One of the worst things about Mutual is matching with someone, sending that person a thoughtful message, and then getting ignored. Unfortunately, this happens far too often. Possible remedies:1) Each person has a queue of, say, 5 waiting messages. Each message must be either responded to or the match removed. Once the queue is full, all new matches will be hidden. If someone removes too many matches, his/her ability to swipe is temporarily revoked.2) If someone ignores more than, say, 50% of new match messages, he/she will be forced to initiate conversations or lose the ability to see new profiles. The danger, of course, is that the system would be easy to game. Somehow each person should be incentivized to make meaningful connections, not try to rack up matches to ignore."
41,164958,Nudges or reminders,Sarah,"02 Mar, 2021",16 Jul,2,In Development,63,Reminders for people you've matched that the matches are about to expire. It should send notifications/reminders to send them a message.
42,179921,Notes should be one per day anytime i want to use it not once every 24 hrs exact,Eliot,"18 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,4,In Development,62,"It could be by date change for example not by how many hours have passed since the last time you used a note. For instance, if I use a note at 1030 p.m. on Monday night and for whatever reason want to send another at 1210 a.m. Tuesday I should be able to do that."
43,175785,Bring back old matches,Greg,"01 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,3,Under consideration,60,Be able to see people you matched with in the past to retry.
44,172670,Show approximate number of people in range,Robert,"17 Mar, 2021",today,2,Under consideration,60,"Show how many men and how many women use mutual in a selected range, can be approximate."
45,170894,Filter specific tag,Sanford Bassett,"18 Mar, 2021",02 Aug,61,Under consideration,57,The ability to see people with a specific tag (even a custom tag) would be an excellent addition.
46,184861,List view of people whove liked you,Anonymous,"12 May, 2021",11 Jul,7,Done,47,Rather than having to go one by one of those who've liked you being able to view in a list similar to bumble would be great!
47,172119,A notification sound,Bradley,"21 Mar, 2021",28 Jul,2,Planned,44,"Whenever I'm outside of the app, I don't notice notifications for sometimes hours, because my phone doesn't vibrate, and no sound goes off, until I turn my screen on and see that the notification is there"
48,161964,Filter pets,Moses,"22 Feb, 2021",28 Jul,2,Done,44,"Pets can be a must or a deal-breaker for certain people. Allow users to specify on their profile that they have or want pets, and make this a filterable attribute on their profile."
49,170233,Group date feature,Jaden,"16 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,6,Under consideration,43,"I'm not entirely sure how this would work. I think an option when creating a profile could be to create a group profile. I know people already do this, but making it easier for people would encourage more group profiles. Then it would encourage group dates, which would relieve a lot of the pressure on dating. And it would make mutual safer for all."
50,176262,Add additional location filter by state,Ryan,"04 Apr, 2021",09 Aug,5,Under consideration,43,"I'd like to filter the search by state. See everyone in Nevada or Texas, etc."
51,197289,Ghosting ratio,Sunny,"10 Jul, 2021",05 Aug,3,Under consideration,40,"Ghosting isn't the worst but it isn't the best. Have a button for people to report ghosting, ask if their sure, and have the app verify there has been no response for a month or so, then report their statistics on their profile. Get rid of people who chronically ghost others ( >75%)"
52,174225,Time stamps,emma,"27 Mar, 2021",28 Jul,3,Under consideration,39,Adding time stamps for each message in a chat would be helpful (I.e. swiping messages to the left to see what time they were sent at)
53,180047,Not for me instead of no reason,Kay,"19 Apr, 2021",2 days ago,1,In Development,39,"It's such a small thing, but it bugs me every single time. Of course I have a reason for unmatching with someone. And it's not any of those other suggestions. Inappropriate behavior isn't the only reason to move on from someone. I simply wish to discontinue my correspondence with that person. Why does that need to fall under the 'Other' category?"
54,184344,Picture upload zoom issue,Daniel,"09 May, 2021",14 Jul,6,In Development,36,"Change mutual feature to stop uploading pictures automatically zoomed in really far. Every time I add a picture it's super zoomed in, would prefer people to see more of me and surroundings"
55,164998,Filter ethnicity,B,"02 Mar, 2021",24 Jul,15,Under consideration,35,
56,165040,Add spotify top artists,Moses,"02 Mar, 2021",09 Aug,8,Under consideration,33,
57,203487,When ward hopping have option to display both real and hopped location,Matt Eden,"17 Aug, 2021",13 Aug,2,Under consideration,33,"It would be nice for the search function to also work from both locations, as the people you are shown have to have your location/statistics within their preferences.  Having both locations displayed would mean you wouldn't have to explain that you dont actually love there."
58,200161,Filter language,Paige,"27 Jul, 2021",23 Jul,14,Done,31,"Filter based on languages. If I only speak English, and a guy doesn't speak English at all, (or vice versa) then it would obviously not be a good match.  For example, users input whatever languages they speak, and then only users with at least one language in common show up as potential matches."
59,190177,See who liked me list view,Michael Patterson,"09 Jun, 2021",16 Jul,8,Under consideration,30,"Rather than have a queue of people who liked you, have a list view that allows you to scroll through and like anybody who liked you. This allows you to browse your list without having to make a decision right away and makes it easier to have the conversations you want to have first."
60,183909,Show new people by most compatible first,Laura,"07 May, 2021",09 Aug,2,Under consideration,29,"Instead of showing new people according to random order or by who is closest, show the people with highest compatibility first (those with similar tags, interest level, etc)"
61,176263,Reset all swipes option,Ryan,"04 Apr, 2021",today,1,Bug,28,"The current refresh oldest 100 thing is very glitchy right now. I click it, but nothing happens unless I change my search parameters. Go back to what we had before."
62,190702,Willing to relocate,mark Osborn,"11 Jun, 2021",16 Jul,3,Done,27,Would be nice to know if someone in a different country/state is willing to relocate to my country/state if we hit it off
63,202492,Make the about me section a required field,Moses Lotulelei,"10 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,2,Under consideration,27,"This encourages higher quality profiles which lead to more meaningful conversations. If someone does not write an about me, it's hard to find conversation starters based solely on their pics."
64,192803,Friends only section,Adam fox,"19 Jun, 2021",16 Jul,14,Under consideration,26,"Used specifically for people just looking for friends, similar to bumble BFF feature. Looking for some homies so this would include dudes seeing other dudes."
65,181754,Filter exclude utah from results,Chris,"26 Apr, 2021",10 Aug,0,Under consideration,26,"I've wished this was a feature for years: a filter to exclude Utah from the search location settings. Dating for members outside of Utah, even being a member outside of Utah, can be very different than being a member actually in Utah. And that's a preference that, at least for me, I'm very interested in. When I do an anywhere search, I get tired of seeing all the Utah results (makes sense, largest demographic). However, the outside Utah people, in the US and rest of the world, I find I actually make contact with more often & enjoy talking to much more. It's just a demographic difference. Even offline, members outside of Utah tend to enjoy connecting more, we can drive an hour easy just to gather & hang out for an afternoon. It's a bit more exciting because we're used to being so few. Without this option, the generic anywhere setting still results in the majority of people shown being Utah people."
66,164931,Filter favorite school,Moses,"01 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,23,Under consideration,24,"Filter through current students/alumni or other users who have a favorite university (e.g. BYU, U of U, Utah State, UVU, etc.)."
67,192616,Add a blind dating feature for people who dont want looks to influence if they m,Chad,"19 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,5,Under consideration,24,
68,175614,Downvote option on the feedback site,Jared,"31 Mar, 2021",2 days ago,5,Not planned,24,"We should have a downvote option on the feedback site. There are many topics, for instance, NCMO's, that the vast majority are opposed to but which would show an abnormal number of likes if they were posted. This bias is introduced because the parties in favor of said topic are more fanatical than the mainstream party. Feeling a strong connection to it means they upvote. It takes too long for some people to add a comment against a topic and they feel that they would be drowned out by many other comments anyway if they were to post (especially after seeing the many upvotes for that topic).  Downvotes would resove this problem and allow a bigger picture for support or opposition to a topic. At the end of the day, this isn't a democracy anyway; Mutual will decide what policies and practices they adopt on their own. I think downvoting is a necessary part of feedback."
69,198340,Filter body type,Stephanie,"17 Jul, 2021",09 Aug,4,Under consideration,24,There was an option for this on ldssingles and many other dating apps. Body types can be something like this: SlimAthleticAbout AverageA Few Extra PoundsCurvyOverweight
70,189478,Get rid of spamfraudulent users,Chele,"07 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,10,In Development,22,There is more spam on this account than any other... I have been asked for money at least 5 times.

73,165226,Facebook mutual friends,Ashlee,"02 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,3,Not planned,19,Ability to see mutual friends on Facebook so I know who to contact to set me up!
74,173851,Limit new matches based on how often you respond to the ones you already have,Josh,"26 Mar, 2021",01 Aug,0,Under consideration,18,"If you want to keep matching/swiping, you should either delete older matches that you've lost interest in, or respond to matches you already have. People would be way less likely to swipe up on people they would ghost, and they may even find love with an old match. It's a good way of encouraging people to seriously investigate people, or at least not waste other people's time. It would also make the ""see who likes me"" feature more appealing since people would want to make the best use of their limited match space.I'd be more interested in a person if I knew they had limited storage and used some on me. Someone with full storage could still come up on other people's feed,  but their feed would say ""You've been talking to 2 out of your 30 matches in the last week.  Reach out to some before you keep matching""People who regularly respond wouldn't have that issue or would at least have more storage. Potentially another premium feature.  50 matches instead of 30. Thank you"
75,173621,Translate messages,Giovanna,"25 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,7,Not planned,17,Many times there are people who know each other but cannot speak due to the language difference.
76,194118,Add education level,Holly,"26 Jun, 2021",17 Jul,3,Under consideration,17,"As someone with a masters degree who makes Clos to 6 figures, I don't want someone who has been working at Walmart since high school. I want an equal. Education is important to me, I also want it to be important to my partner.  It could be a drop down with options: (high school, tech school, some college, bachelor's, graduate degree)"
77,169247,Fix ig integration,Anonymous,"13 Mar, 2021",11 Jul,2,Bug,17,Ig photos are zoomed in when expanded and there is no way to scroll the image
78,164972,World wide distance,Cole,"02 Mar, 2021",03 Jul,2,Under consideration,17,"If I choose to look at everyone world wide, it would be nice to have an option where the distance starts out close to my area then slowly expands outward"
79,179087,Add more then 2 letters for the state or country better geographic clarity pleas,James McLean,"14 Apr, 2021",03 Aug,0,Under consideration,17,"As a global app, 2 letters is just not enough to clearly identify the location. What does CA mean? Cambodia, Canada, California'?. 2 letters are not enough, especially when you're not even consistent with whether it is a state or country. If it is a state then add the country. Better yet, you could use a small pic of the country's flag. That would save screen space and add character to the app."
80,172209,Home screen should be messaging,Dan,"21 Mar, 2021",14 Jul,0,Under consideration,17,Home Screen should be messaging not back to more profiles. This will allow us to focus on our matches and not on just swiping.

84,175897,Publish dating market statistics for an area,Trent,"02 Apr, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,16,"Or sell them, if mutual needs the money. Basically the app has a lot of interesting data already (how many lds people are dating in X city, how many swipes result in a match, how many matches result in a two way message, what portion of users are male/female in a given area, how many people does it take to get a match on average, etc).  YSA move around a lot and it would be very helpful and valuable to have an idea for these sorts of things ('oh, the job offer in Chicago has 200 mutual users in the area, but the offer in DC has 600, good to know'). I bet plenty of users would pay $10+ for a detailed report and it would cost very little to produce since the app already knows it's user base.  More personalized reports like 'X percent of people swipe up on this photo, Y percent on this other photo' or even 'of 1000 male profiles in the area, users swipe on you more than they do on 550 of the others' etc would also be interesting. The user base generates the data, let them see it."
85,173770,Party room,Braeden,"25 Mar, 2021",14 Jul,0,Under consideration,16,"(This tries to mirror connecting with people at a party)  Display the first profile pic of 6 different people side by side. The user taps 2 of those people to ""get to know better"". The other 4 people go away, and the user sees those 2 people's whole profile.  They swipe up or down, then 6 new people come up, in the same process.  The 4 people they did not choose do not show up again for 1 week (or maybe 24 hours), after which they will come back around in the rotation.  (This adds a fun element of decision, sort of like at a party where you have a limited amount of time to spend talking to people) Might be a fun twist!"
86,164969,Scroll bar,Cole,"02 Mar, 2021",02 Aug,0,Under consideration,16,"Make the distance bar not a slide bar, but instead one of those scroll wheel things. The slide bar is too inconvenient for thousands of miles to be on"
87,199535,Fix photo sizing,Kyra,"26 Jul, 2021",12 Jul,4,Under consideration,15,"Sometimes when I try to add a photo that isn't the exact size it needs it to be, I have to resize it or screenshot it. Some of them turn out blurry or sized weird"
88,194685,See at least 1 person per week,Micah Conover,"29 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,0,Done,15,"I think it would be nice to get to see at least 1 person who likes me per week for free. That wouldn't get rid of the incentive to pay to see the 99+ people who like me, but it would make it so I could match a little more easily. Sometimes it's discouraging to swipe for a long while, and exit the app without any luck. Being able to see someone who likes me each week, would at least insure that I come across something that could be mutual, once in a while."
89,282931,Family tree app linked to this,Hailey,26 Feb,03 Aug,2,Under consideration,14,"I have had a 2nd cousin swipe up and communicate with multiple girls he's related to. Not me, but 2 of my cousins. They found this out at a family funeral and as you can imagine, it was quite funny/awkward. Since there are no last names, I think the family tree app that says how closely you're related would be helpful hahah."
90,186715,Allow those who you have liked to see you liked them,Anonymous,"21 May, 2021",16 Jul,2,Planned,14,"When people pay for the membership on the app, it should allow people who you swipe up on be able to see that you want to connect with them. Otherwise I feel like you have just as much of a chance of finding a connection as someone who doesn't pay for the app."

I love being able to heart a message, emphasize a message etc. I just had the thought to maybe add another feature where you can reply to specific messages like you can imessage."
93,192772,Be able to set your location to your home city while traveling,Jacob Coleman,"19 Jun, 2021",14 Jul,0,Done,14,It would be great to be able to still have your location be your home location while traveling. This way you can still find singles within reasonable distance while traveling and not feel like the app is completely useless because it's you can only look at singles in your vacation location.
94,173521,Questionnaire,Jared,"25 Mar, 2021",09 Aug,0,Not planned,14,"Everyone can answer the questions they're comfortable with and then you can check a match's answers to the questions that you've answered yourself. In order to see the answers to questions that you haven't taken, you have to answer the corresponding question (to prevent ppl from saying what a match wants to hear). To prevent addictive behavior and to reward consistent app use, there could be a limit to the number of questions that can be answered per day (e.g. 10 questions). Maybe this wouldn't apply to answering questions a match had answered (while looking at a match). Premium users could then see a match % based on the questions and interest tags"
95,186181,Optional profile feedback,Jeremy,"18 May, 2021",09 Aug,5,Under consideration,13,"Instead of swiping down, the user could have the option to provide constructive feedback on a profile by choosing from a list of common profile mistakes or sending an anonymous message.  Examples:Too many people in photosUnflattering photosInappropriate photosGeneric descriptionSpelling and grammarBio is negative, disrespectful, immature, boring, too brief, inappropriateToo few or too many interests User could select all that apply. Receiving feedback could be opt-in only. Feedback could also be in the form of an anonymous message but would probably be abused. Inappropriate messages could be reported."

Then mutual could maybe filter so similar people show up more often. These could also just let mutual know what things we swipe based on. Even if it's every few swipes instead of every one..."
102,176239,Pause profile,Amanda,"04 Apr, 2021",09 Aug,0,Done,13,It would be cool if we could pause our accounts for a while if we don't want to deactivate it but we also aren't wanting to show up on other people's profiles or anything.
103,175898,Option for more detailed profile info,Trent,"02 Apr, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,13,"Allow users to create a 'bonus' profile with more personal information about what they want in life, what they're into, what they care abt in a partner etc that they can grant access to after matching or after going out w another user and having a good time.  Profiles (and first dates) tend to be intentionally light hearted and nobody wants to ask 'how many kids do you want to have' or 'are you/have you been a pornography user' or 'what sort of income/spending level do you expect to have' or 'what is something that you find attractive/unattractive in a partner' or 'if your spouse left the church do you think you'd be more likely to break up, or to leave the church yourself' etc etc.  Basically it would be like a 'level 2' profile that you share selectively w someone once you've built some trust or connection. Nobody wants to go into date one or two throwing those topics on the table at a restaurant but many people are interested in them for compatibility."

I am fairly confident this will significantly reduce people unintentionally ghosting each other and generally help response times. This is the norm for messaging across the boards on smartphones, and would be very useful here. Every app also has a setting to disable it, which y'all could also throw in there pretty easily"

112,266157,The new about me section is too short,Liz,"27 Dec, 2021",01 Aug,4,Under consideration,11,"The old section was much better. I really felt like I could learn a bit about a person. This is way too short now! Other sites like Hinge and Bumble include a lot more info in your stats section (kids status, politics etc) so they don't need as much room in the About Me section but this is ridiculously short!!"
113,189906,Make the distance slider better,Ryan,"08 Jun, 2021",23 Jul,3,Under consideration,11,The distance slider should be exponential. The most useful range is 0-40 miles anyway so instead of that being 4mm long on the slider it should take up half of the slider.
114,200613,No dead animals,Kelsi,"28 Jul, 2021",03 Aug,2,Under consideration,11,"I'm so sick of seeing dead deer, elk, fish, etc. on guys' profiles. There are other photos someone can upload to indicate they enjoy hunting and/or fishing, but nobody needs to see the actual dead animal."
115,188116,Get rid of say hi,J,"31 May, 2021",08 Jul,1,Under consideration,11,"In addition to the suggestion for conversation prompts... it would be amazing to replace the 'say hi' prompt that comes up after a match, because that is quite often the ONLY thing that people say... and I had to stop getting mad when I realized that people are just doing what the app told them to do :P"
116,187180,Purge users,Bparks,"25 May, 2021",09 Aug,0,Done,11,"I get the feeling that a lot of the people on the app are married or don't use it. In other words, it feels like the swiping is bloated based off of false profiles. Maybe consider purging users who have been inactive for a couple of years."
117,164959,Tagging the other people in the photo,Alex,"02 Mar, 2021",09 Aug,0,Not planned,11,Sometimes I wanna know who the other cutie is... so if they like tagged their profile or insta that would be great
118,177626,Repeal height filter,Aaron,"09 Apr, 2021",08 Jul,8,Under consideration,10,This encourages the stigma of rejecting someone based on their height. A genetic predisposition that cannot be changed.
119,281412,Force users to complete verification,Michael,20 Feb,09 Aug,2,Under consideration,10,"Users should be forced complete verification before they can show up in the matchmaker.

121,210998,Superlike feature,alberthallingtonianianan,"31 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,0,In Development,10,"It can be difficult to tell if a swipe means anything coming from another party. It could mean they're actually interested, or it could (and only too often does) mean absolutely nothing at all. It would be appropriate to have some sort of ""superlike"" feature that would allow you to do one of two things: 1 - ""superlike"" a profile as you're casually swiping. This could be some sort of button or whatever, similar to how you would send a note... but not necessarily needing to send a message.  2 - provided you have already matched with someone, you could ""upgrade"" your ""like"" to a ""superlike"" and thus let the other person know you're ACTUALLY INTERESTED.  This simple feature would eliminate a great deal of confusion."
122,186991,Check to mark your divorce is finalized,A,"23 May, 2021",10 Jul,0,Not planned,10,"I've come across so many guys where they are still married. It's in the fine print your divorce needs to be finalized, but you need to make them actually check a box to move on the next page of setting up their profile. It needs to be in their face"

126,184715,Show which chats you havent replied to,Alex,"11 May, 2021",07 Jul,1,Planned,9,Matches seem to come in waves and sometimes its easy to miss or forget to reply to a message when there's a bunch at once. In other apps there's an icon in your list of chats showing which convos are 'your turn' to reply. This makes it a lot easier to not miss a message and or remember to reply if you checked it while busy.

130,194489,Filter modesty,Mitch,"29 Jun, 2021",04 Aug,5,Not planned,8,"Be able to filter out anyone who is wearing immodest clothing (bikini, shirtless, etc.) in their profile pictures.

132,222916,Another ui overhaul,Ammon,"09 Oct, 2021",03 Aug,2,Under consideration,8,"The latest UI update that changed the majority of the app interface is just bad. The change in font, the positioning of names/locations, and the massive menu bar at the bottom makes it feel like an app from 2012, not 2021. The old design was SO clean and easy to use, I can't understand what possessed the team to make such drastic changes for the worse. In its current state, I have a hard time spending any time in the app because it feels so stunted and clunky. My suggestion in one sentence: Revert the UI back to the old version or spend more time making it better."
133,190987,Account vacationtake a break mode,Adam Proctor,"13 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,2,Done,8,You can set your account to take a break beachside you need some time away but don't want to delete or leave it live and do am major clean up. This is so you don't need to delete the account and you would not come back to matches that that may have been around and the user think you did not
134,232162,More info snippets,Sid,"12 Nov, 2021",09 Aug,1,Planned,8,"Something I really appreciate in the Hinge App, that I would also love to see in Mutual, would be a section/scrollbar for more quick snippets of info.  In Hinge, they have a little 'optional' section that includes quick, possibly deal-breaker info  with cute, easy icons included, like, 'has kids', 'wants kids', 'drinks sometimes', 'never smokes', etc. I would appreciate adding even more on Mutual than what Hinge has like, 'is ok with cussing' or other more culturally-specific tid-bits."
135,218963,Allow users to hide read receipts,Michael Allen,"26 Sep, 2021",26 Jul,1,Under consideration,8,"Not everyone has the time to respond right away to messages. Users should be allowed to enable and disable read receipts. On Mutual, this appears as two check marks next to a sent message that has been viewed by the receiver. Other dating apps allow you to do this. It could be a simple toggle switch in the settings of the app."
136,187103,Reverify people regularly,Isabella,"24 May, 2021",03 Jul,1,Done,8,"Its easy to get verified and then change your pictures after, maybe reverifying people every few months or something to help maintain peoples integrity and keep people on the app safe:)"

But when I went in to messages that person was deleted from my message page. I can only assume he decided he wasn't interested, and unmatched me. It would be nice if the app notified you of this."
140,201202,Premium lite,Josh,"02 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,8,"Different subscription ""plans"" for mutualUp that are more affordable and have fewer features. For example, Premium Lite could give users access to a couple things like just the height filter and additional notes."

Many people are looking for someone with particular traits like blond hair, blue eyes etc. For those people it would make the app more effective by incorporating this feature. Similar idea to height filter."
143,175219,Down to chat toggle,Jairon Terrero,"30 Mar, 2021",09 Aug,3,Under consideration,7,"Even if I swipe down on someone, I'm still more than happy to chat, exchange memes, and make friends that person. Similarly, I would love to just make friends with the people that I don't match with (regardless of which of us doesn't swipe up). I think making a dynamic that allows people to get to know each other without any expectations about having to go on a date or make a relationship would make the process more natural and appealing to everyone. As such, it would be cool to be able to toggle a feature that lets anyone say hi to me (or me to them if they have it enabled). I realize this is an awful lot like sending notes, but I feel like sending notes just seems act of desperation haha so I never do it. All in all, it would be great if the platform could be used to meet friends rather than only bringing together people who both find each other attractive."
144,169315,Picture suggestions,Jake,"14 Mar, 2021","26 Jul, 2021",3,Done,7,"Its rough when someone adds a picture and they have a facemask, are with 3 other people, it's their dog, or otherwise don't show themselves at all. I have no idea what they look like when they do that.  When creating your account maybe have suggestions for adding pictures and maybe an AI to detect if the picture ""doesn't show you very well"" doesn't have to block the picture just.. suggest an edit."
145,285801,Gpsprivacy,None of your beeswax,14 Mar,03 Aug,2,Under consideration,7,"GPS is wrong. Since you're the one who know your legal address and may or may not be accessing the app from home, you should be able to manually edit where you are from, choose if you want the app to access your GPS or not, and still be able to use the app. Being forced to provide the physical location where you are at any exact moment in order to use the app at all is invasive to privacy/not safe, potentially inaccurate to where one lives, and a violation of free agency. Manually typing in a city/state or zip code for a general search, and selecting to keep ones location private should be allowed."
146,210999,Match guide,alberthallingtonianianan,"31 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,2,Under consideration,7,"This is a feature that facebook dating has and that I think would do absolutely wonderful on mutual. You should be able to (and even be encouraged to) fill out a voluntary ""match guide"" that would give your potential matches some sort of idea what you expect. Some people handle sarcasm really well, others not so much. Some people want a funny, cheesy, sarcastic pickup line, while other people think those are dumb and would prefer you to be direct.  A short ""match guide"" that users fill out and that would be displayed once you match with someone would really help both parties understand what the other is expecting and would likely lead to better conversations, more engagement, and thus more success, more refferals to mutual, more time spent on the app, more ad impressions, more mutualUp users, etc.  Beneficial to all parties involved."
147,189876,Mix in people that like me,TJ,"08 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,2,Done,7,I've been swiping through people for hours and the number of people that like me still hasn't changed up or down. I don't want to pay to see exactly who likes me. Please mix them in with all the other people. This seems like the opposite of what this app is supposed to do.
148,169853,I dont like you,Alec,"15 Mar, 2021",07 Jul,2,Not planned,7,When you're swiping down on someone in the normal queue they're immediately taken out of the see who liked you queue

Regular membership for $4.99/mo with up to three matches that have unlimited messages after the first five. Premium membership for $9.99/mo that allows unlimited everything and includes other perks like video calls, giveaways for dates, calendar sharing so people can set up dates, discounts to events when tickets are bought through the app and more. Most other dating apps make most of their money through sponsorships for discount codes and purchase made through them."
151,284319,Inability to screenshot,Lily,06 Mar,10 Jul,0,Under consideration,7,"A privacy feature, like so many streaming services have, that doesn't allow/causes a blacked-out screen for screenshots would allay reservations some users might have about creating an account."

It would be an ""if you liked this person chances are you'll also like this person"" sort of feature."
153,195253,Pause locations,Josh,"02 Jul, 2021",14 Jul,0,Done,7,"I think it'd be great to pause your location for when you go on short trips. That way you can still be active but not have your location change because you're away for the weekend. In situations where it's a longer trip, i.e. more than a week or two, users should probably pause their profile or just not use Mutual for the time being."
154,192814,Remove unnecessary notifications,Mac,"19 Jun, 2021",01 May,0,Bug,7,"Stop telling me ""your next adventure is just a swipe away"" or whatever. Your random notifications are annoying and unnecesaary"

161,188118,More profile prompts,J,"31 May, 2021",27 May,1,Planned,6,It can help people start a profile (and can help in starting a conversation) if people can list answers to multiple profile prompts/questions to answer about themselves rather than just one message box that says 'say something about yourself' or 'would you rather skydive or shark dive'.
162,165097,Filter instagram profile,Leonard,"02 Mar, 2021","31 Jul, 2021",1,Not planned,6,I have seen many profiles that takes advantage of the app to raise their Instagram profile followers.
163,299626,Three strikes youre out,JJ,13 May,yesterday,0,Done,6,"For the sisters, and the brethren, but especially for the sisters being bothered by any potential sex pests, making an option to tag a conversation with a red flag that gets the pest blocked from that user but also filters them into a pool where if they are flagged by two other people as inappropriate gets their account reviewed for permanent deletion. That way Mutual creators don't have to take it upon themselves what is and isn't appropriate, like Twitter. But the person making judgement call on what is and isn't appropriate to them is the person the comments are being directed at.  One case could just be a difference of opinions on what is and isn't appropriate. Three cases is a red flag for review.  The system would also work for people soliciting money."
164,269055,Replace gloomy cloud image,Jonathan,05 Jan,09 Aug,0,Planned,6,"Please replace the gloomy gray cloud image when there are no more results. Maybe a sky image, or a temple, or the mountains or ocean. That gray photo is so depressing. It's sad enough that there are no more results, we need a photo that communicates hope and happiness, not that we're entering outer darkness. Thank you so much!!!"
165,268925,Texting vs in person,Sarah,05 Jan,09 Aug,0,Under consideration,6,"Lots of people say they prefer to meet up in person before texting too long, but I like to get to know someone over text for a long time before spending time in person. Can there be a slider or tag for this?"
166,232160,Swipe up feedback,Sid,"12 Nov, 2021",12 Aug,0,Planned,6,"I love the Hinge app's feature that requires a user to select a specific part of a person's profile to like in order to 'swipe up' on someone. It personalizes the 'swiping' a bit more & makes users slow down a bit. The option to include a message too, with the 'like' selection, is pretty nice as well. This feature gives feedback to the person in a positive manner about what the user found interesting in one's profile and allows conversation to start more naturally by allowing one to essentially comment on a specific part of a profile. Also, likely because of this feature, the app has spread out the photos between prompts, which makes the profile more interesting to look through and encourages reading about the individual rather than solely paying attention to looks initially."
167,205697,Dont erase chats,Mike,"29 Aug, 2021",10 Jul,0,Done,6,Please don't erase chat conversations after a matter of weeks.  Please consider leaving them up permanently or at least 4-6 months.
168,203302,Unblock,Keith,"16 Aug, 2021",07 Jul,0,Under consideration,6,How do I see who I have blocked and maybe even unblock them?
169,190895,Refresh messages within the messages page,Brett,"12 Jun, 2021",03 Jul,0,Under consideration,6,Being able to swipe down from the top of the messages page to refresh messages. Right now I have to go in and out of the page to do so.
170,187004,No more ghost matches,X,"23 May, 2021",09 Aug,0,Bug,6,I have over 30 likes that I never get to even if I have no more to swipe on. Let people swipe on everyone even if they disappear from the filter range.
171,203999,Recommend a swipe to a friend,Dea,"21 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,4,Done,5,"I have a lot of friends on mutual.   Frequently as I am scrolling through my feed, I will see a match and think, this sounds like someone my friend ____ would like.   But based on my friends filters they might never see them. Could we make it so I could somehow share or recommend a swipe to a friend?"
172,188240,X miles away,Madeleine,"01 Jun, 2021",03 Jul,3,Not planned,5,"We have our distance filters, but some live in areas with very few members and must set the distance filter to 100, 200, or 250 miles for enough variety/choices.  It would be nice to see an exact distance with a given match so you don't have to google their location to see how difficult it would be to actually meet up in person."
173,285645,Photo descriptions more photos,Bartholemew,13 Mar,14 Aug,2,Under consideration,5,Add descriptions to our uploaded photos as well as adding to the number of photos one can upload.
174,224559,Exclude certain locations,Cory,"13 Oct, 2021",14 Jul,2,Under consideration,5,If I want to search worldwide but exclude a state or a country
175,198315,Match reminder,Garret,"17 Jul, 2021",01 Aug,2,Under consideration,5,One idea I have is you could send reminders to people who they've matched with and give them a 2 day reminder if they haven't wrote to their match yet.
176,253900,Background check every profile claim,Joel,"04 Dec, 2021",25 May,1,Not planned,5,"Every attribute on a profile should have a background check process behind it to confirm it. Examples of important profile claims that should be verified by a background check service includes: martial status, children, income, credit score, job history, education, and criminal record. The results of a medical checkup would confirm height, weight, drug/substance usage, and fitness level."
177,199469,Connect with others who served in same mission or where you live,Heather Elise Harkness,"25 Jul, 2021",23 Jul,1,Under consideration,5,Connect with others who served in same mission or where you live.
178,188038,Change ux to incorporate text and pictures,Joshua,"30 May, 2021","04 Sep, 2021",1,Under consideration,5,"Instead of tapping to see more about a person, you swiping left and right should alternate between pictures and text. For example:Screen 1 PhotoScreen 2 Name, location, about me blurbScreen 3 PhotoScreen 4 Work, education, mission Screen 5 photoScreen 6 small blurb like favorite first date, thing I couldn't live without, etc (like a random tidbit fact)Screen 7 photo Screen 8 small blurb again (but different) like favorite first date, thing I couldn't live without, etc (like a random tidbit fact)Screen 9 Photo Screen 10 instagram, Spotify"
179,284245,Change the screen after a match,Aaron,05 Mar,09 Jul,0,Planned,5,The screen we see when we match with someone causes a poor experience. We see half of our own face (which isn't pretty unnecessary) and half the face of the person we matched with (which is pretty unhelpful). The only thing we can do at that point is message the person right away and can't even view their profile.  The only way we can look at their profile to do that is to exit out of the 50% face screen and go into our conversations to find the people we've matched with but haven't yet spoken to. It doesn't flow well at all. It would be better if we could see right into their profile to find a picture or party of their bio to comment on.
180,272690,Add a spot for special needs people,Justin,19 Jan,03 Aug,0,Under consideration,5,To have a spot just for special needs people of the church.  There are a lot of us in the church and we want to have friends and meet people who are like us and others.
181,221447,Stop repeating,Scott,"03 Oct, 2021",03 Jul,0,Bug,5,I've been cycling through the same people repeatedly within a few minutes. I'd suggest you see if that something you can fix.
182,220259,Better verification,Ronnie,"28 Sep, 2021",12 Aug,0,Under consideration,5,Make people do a more thorough verification process that they are human and not a bot.
183,197187,Remove unnecessary notifications,Mac,"09 Jul, 2021",27 May,0,Planned,5,"I posted this before and they labeled it as a bug. THIS IS NOT A BUG! It's unnecessary notifications that are akin to Facebook sending ""someone you MIGHT know is on facebook"". I don't care and it's a shameless attempt to get people to get on the app and it's so annoying! The worst part is that if you turn off these notifications it also turns off notifications for matches and messages. I just want you to get rid of irrelevant and unnecessary notifications."
184,194293,Verify by member record number,Rachel,"28 Jun, 2021",19 Jul,0,Not planned,5,Have people verify their profiles through their church record number. It will make the app safer and that way we'll know whether the person is truly LDS.
185,192615,Put people who have liked me in the front of my feed,Chad,"19 Jun, 2021",09 Aug,0,Done,5,
186,189874,Fix people showing up twice,TJ,"08 Jun, 2021",14 Jul,0,Done,5,"When I'm swiping through people, there will be times when someone shows up a second time, even after I've liked/disliked them."
187,188057,Reset undo removed deleted match matches,Dallin,"30 May, 2021",23 Feb,0,Not planned,5,"At times I have unmatched from multiple women (deleted/removed a match) and wish I could undo it, but I can't. The only way is if I delete my profile and start a new profile from scratch with the hope of finding them again."
188,186483,Height filter,Ella,"20 May, 2021",22 Jul,0,Done,5,"I don't understand why the height filter only works on my end. I only see specific people of the height range that I set, but people who are below/above that range can still swipe on me, which then shows up in my 'see people who have swiped up on you' section. I have that filter set for a reason. This doesn't happen with the age filter. I don't think anyone above or below my age range can see me. Why can't that happen with the height filter?"
189,183418,List location next to name in matches and archives,Brett,"04 May, 2021",27 May,0,Under consideration,5,"It is possible to accumulate quite a few contacts in Matches and Archives scattered all over the country, people I would love to meet in person, but it is tough to remember where they are from. It would be nice if next to their name in Matches and Archives it displayed their location as well. It seems like it would be easy to implement and it would be very handy... at least to me."
190,264559,New layout problematic,Mikki,"22 Dec, 2021",17 Feb,6,Done,4,"Hi. Mutual is a great app and has always been super user friendly. The new layout design, however, is problematic. When you click on a profile to get someone's info and read their profile, some of the info is cut off as it doesn't fill the whole screen. There are many profiles I've clicked on where their height (in the upper right hand corner) gets cut off. Height is important to me, so that is very problematic. Why did you change the layout? It was actually better before. :)"
191,192905,Filter matches by location,Dax,"20 Jun, 2021",07 Jul,2,Done,4,Be able to filter the matches you have by proximity to you.  If you're in St George you can see your match's in st George first or if you're in salt lake the same thing
192,302990,Clean slate,James Franckum,27 May,19 Jul,1,Done,4,"There should be a way to 'Restart', re-boot, or start from a clean slate with your profile.  Some times you match with a person and it doesn't work out on the first swipe."
193,262981,Favorite quote,Nic,"18 Dec, 2021",12 Aug,1,Planned,4,"Under the 'About Me' topics, there could be a choice for favorite quote. I've seen a good amount of profiles that's use one underneath the About me section. I think having the ability to make its own thing will a long way. As quotes can tell you what kind of person you're potential match is."
194,184394,Have mutual make leaving feedback or contacting admin easily accessible,Danny,"10 May, 2021",05 Jan,1,Done,4,"There have been a few times that I have had a suggestion or an issue, and unless I get the admin profile to 'make a suggestion' inserted between actual profiles, I can't make any suggestions or inquiries. There is no 'contact us' section or an easily and readily accessible comment link. It is random by chance when you are swiping on profiles. It seems to me that any app, particularly one that doesn't mind taking our money, really ought to make suggestions or issues something that everyone can easily do and find. It is phenomenally  frustrating and shady looking when you don't."
195,168995,A mutual themed apples to apples like game called its mutual,Samuel Ambler,"12 Mar, 2021","23 Jun, 2021",1,Not planned,4,"The game is like apples to apples or what do you meme but based on Mutual. Basically someone will read a card which is the initial message after matching and then everyone else will put in a card with the response and then the reader will read the responses and choose the best/funniest. An example could be the initial card just says ""Hey."" And then some responses could be ""I think you should talk to your bishop"", ""Not what I was expecting from an RM"" or ""You're definitely EC material"". The name of the game would then be It's Mutual"
196,319288,Add asl as a language option,Elizabeth Anderson,29 Jul,13 Aug,0,Under consideration,4,I'm not Deaf myself but ASL was my first language because I have a lot of deaf family! I think it would be more inclusive if we could put ASL as one of our languages :)
197,303534,Auto correctgrammer check while writing your message,Stuart Bailey,29 May,28 Jul,0,Bug,4,Sometimes people are in a hurry while writing a message and sometimes they either misspelled a word or bad Grammer on accident. So having a spell check and grammar check button before sending the message.
198,251980,Voice memo included in bio with prompt question,Adam Garaycochea,"29 Nov, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,4,"Adding a prompt question with a voice memo response would make your profile much more real, and personal."
199,202351,Diversify your app store ad pictures,Sarah,"09 Aug, 2021",03 Aug,0,Planned,4,"The photos in your App Store ad pictures are all of women/from the man's scrolling perspective. It'd be nice if there were photos of men's profiles, like a woman would see if she was scrolling through. Also all the models are white :/"
200,201602,Notifications go away from your notification bar if youve opened the app,K,"04 Aug, 2021",09 Aug,0,Bug,4,"If I get a notification about a message or a new match, and I open the app through the app not the notification, the notification stays on my notification bar. It's pretty annoying. I open my phone and there's 4 mutual symbols, so I get excited. Then it just links back to old messages I already read."
201,200947,Make more moneys,Brenton Kloepfer,"31 Jul, 2021",09 Aug,0,Under consideration,4,"A way you could make more money is by having a feature where you can send a week or a month or whatever of free mutual to someone else. For example, Dwight you're single and it's your birthday, here's a month of mutual up on the house. The friend buys it gives it to Dwight as like a birthday present or something. You can do it with iBooks etc."

205,175297,See who has premium,Mary,"31 Mar, 2021","03 May, 2021",0,Not planned,4,"Nothing is worse than being left on read. So sometimes I'd like to be able to know if the other person has premium so I know if they see when I open their message or not. Sometimes I'm just busy and can't respond right away, but if I know they've seen that I've read their message, I'd try to answer more quickly. If they can't see it, I wouldn't feel anxious for reading it and not responding ASAP."
206,263612,Delete about me prompts,Cameron,"20 Dec, 2021",17 Feb,3,Under consideration,3,We can't delete questions/prompts to add to bio's. We want to get rid of questions
207,253882,Filter income level,Joel,"04 Dec, 2021",28 May,2,Not planned,3,"Add filtering by income level. To be allowed to claim a certain income level on profile, require user to upload financial documents that a background check service verifies. Similar to the approval process for buying a home."
208,198980,Delete message,Rosa,"22 Jul, 2021",27 May,2,Under consideration,3,"To be able to delete messages, when one makes a mistake when we're writing,"
209,263544,Freeze profilematches,KJ,"19 Dec, 2021",yesterday,1,Done,3,"If you have matched with several people and start going out with one of them, it can become awkward to still be on the app. You don't know where the relationship is going, and you don't want to ghost the people in your chat, but it can also feel like you're cheating to keep talking to others in that situation. A 'freeze profile/chat' feature would still show you in current matches with others, but you wouldn't show up as available in future searches, and your profile would appear blurred or washed out so existing matches could see you are temporarily unavailable but interested in picking things up in the future. :)It is also frustrating to match with people who may just have neglected to shut down their profile after starting a relationship, so you never hear from them."
210,202015,Save message as draft,Zach,"06 Aug, 2021",27 May,1,Under consideration,3,Save a message as a draft so you can finish/send a text later if you are interrupted

Ex: I want to see everyone within 100 miles, it starts with people five miles away and then shows me people 10 miles away."
213,308219,Make sending a note or comment required to send a like,Patrick,15 Jun,21 Jul,0,Under consideration,3,"To make swiping more intentional, make it so you have to send a note or leave a comment on something to send a like. This would make people self impose swiping limits and increase connection rather than just swiping mindlessly. This also would make it so sending notes is more normal and natural. On other apps like hinge, where leaving comments is as common as just a like,  you get so much more conversation and connection than on swiping apps"
214,306835,How about you give other payment options beside dam google,Randle,10 Jun,05 Jul,0,Planned,3,I would give you money if you did have other payment options  besides  Google!!!!!
215,306328,Filter out inactive or hardly used profiles,Thomas F,08 Jun,05 Jul,0,Planned,3,"It seems like I run into lots of people I'm interested in, however It never seems to go anywhere. Just because the people I'm Interested in to begin with never get on Mutual. So I don't know if there's a way to make a filter so the people who use Mutual frequently enough who they can talk to. I know there's the verified profile thing, but beyond that I don't know of anything else. I feel like this would be helpful to do."

221,197244,Swiped up by mistake,Robert Hernandez,"09 Jul, 2021",09 Aug,0,Done,3,This option would automatically erase an user's profile that another user matched with by accident. This is gonna help avoiding embarrassing situations like texting a girl and she never answering back or vice versa.

228,190517,Tag match ratios,Jared,"10 Jun, 2021","25 Aug, 2021",0,Under consideration,3,"You should change / add the way you display tags numbers in the main person screen. So rather that it just being the number of similarities, it's a ratio between similarities and the total number of tags the other person has. Right now if I see a large number I immediately ask if the person has a billion tags and they usually do, but if they had a smaller number of total tags and a larger portion of those tags matched that would be something I'd be interested in knowing right off the bat."
229,189753,Dont start showing my halfcreated profile until i tell you im done with it,Kendra,"08 Jun, 2021",10 Jul,0,Bug,3,"The app crashed while I was in the middle of creating my profile and saved it as complete, and there was no way to turn off the half-finished profile so I had to panickedly write one and add pictures (which kept failing to upload) until it was at least was not embarrassing.

238,180019,Stop scrolling to the top after click on a conversation and hit the back button,Gianny Ice,"18 Apr, 2021",09 Jun,0,Bug,3,"It's pretty annoying when I'm going through my list of conversations, click on one to read or respond, and then get sent back to the top of my conversations list. I then have to scroll down until I find where I was at. It should remember your scroll position so when you hit the back button from a conversation, it doesn't jump to the top."
239,318607,Change the school feature,Bryant,27 Jul,27 Jul,3,In Development,2,OK this is really stupid that you have to either choose 'no college' or say that you have a degree. It's just confusing. I wish that it would have an option for 'currently attending' or some other option  people can see that I'm going to Utah state but it doesn't look like I'm a drop out or something because it says 'No College- USU'

261,228666,Communities,Moses Lotulelei,"27 Oct, 2021",05 Jan,0,Under consideration,2,"Allow people to create groups or communities. (stakes maybe?) that others can join. These communities would allow people who joined to match with others in the community and would act as a sort of additional filter. Maybe certain communities are geo-fenced or have passwords or approvals?For example, someone could join 'BYU Idaho' and would only be able to join there if they are within 25 miles... Or if you tried to join a ""45-60 LDS Singles"" group, you would have to be approved possibly by an admin or something of the group...Or they could be just locations around the world that anyone can join to meet others.

296,318617,Seeing the number of people who like you is demoralizing,Steph,27 Jul,27 Jul,0,Under consideration,1,"It is super demoralizing to see how few people have 'liked' my profile. Every time I log in it is a constant reminder how unappealing my profile is. For those who have the 99+ all the time it's likely no big deal but for those few of us who see a specific number it is honestly just depressing. I get you are trying to sell the subscription but seeing a low number doesn't make me want to pay for a subscription. It makes me want to give up on dating all together. Especially when I get the freebie to see someone who 'liked' me and I swipe down on all of them because their profile tells me immediately we wouldn't be compatible, this only strengthens the dark voice in my head saying I'm not worthy of finding a compatible partner. I get it I'm not attractive, and my info is unappealing, but within the limits of the app it is the best I can do. I am a good person worthy of love  but according to mutual I am nothing but a failure, do I really need the constant reminder?"

When you go to the chat, half my face is cut off leaving an unflattering thumbnail of my mouth and below. I've seen profile pictures of double chins, cleavage, etc. That's what people see in the messaging, so please give us a way to fix profile pictures that are not displayed correctly."
306,291760,Punch in boxes for preferences,Makayla,08 Apr,08 Apr,0,Under consideration,1,"It would be easier to have boxes to type in your preferred ages or the miles/location, instead of the sliding bars. When I go to slide the dots that are close together they don't slide. I have to move the far end further up the bar in order to move the low end."

Well, this is a lost opportunity that this and every other dating app has missed. Instead of this tedious 1-to-1 matching method, which, let's face it, is mathematically unlikely to find your ""solemate"" or similar (search for the relevant XKCD What If article), instead, let's leverage the connections and friendships we each have. Similar to the ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"", everyone on the planet is connected by only a few steps. Let's find a way that we can each play ""matchmaker"" and bless those who are frustrated after years of endless swiping. Here is a proposal: I pay a $17 bounty to Mutual, and Mutual will broker/reward $15 (or one month free subscription) to whoever shares my profile with the kind of girl I'm looking for, and said girl agrees that I seem pretty awesome and accepts the recommendation.  Any better ideas?"
